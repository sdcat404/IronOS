# IronOS
The worlds worst OS (other than Win8)

# Whats IronOS? 
IronOS is a monolithic kernal built in one single file using the COSMOS framework.

# What can I do with IronOS? 
You can read and write to files, thats pretty fun!
You can tell the time too, also pretty fun.
You can show disk space!
You "should" be able to ping devices connected to the same network but im still trying to figure out how to do that...

# Why should i use IronOS over other OS's? 
You shoudn't... If you want to install an OS that's currently in dev and hardly works then please use this! 

# What does IronOS do that Windows / Linux doesn't?
It has a cat as its mascot... Just trust me bro. It doesn't need to do anything else.
